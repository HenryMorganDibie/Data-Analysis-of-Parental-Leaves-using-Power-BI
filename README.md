# Data-Analysis-of-Parental-Leaves-using-Power-BI
# Here are some insights that can be drawn from the data analysis:

* Maternity leave policies: The data shows that some companies provide significantly more paid maternity leave than others. Guild Education and WeWork, both in the "Business Services: Other" industry, provide the highest amount of paid maternity leave at 14 weeks, while Randstad USA in the same industry provides only 5 weeks. On average, companies in the dataset provide 9.2 weeks of paid maternity leave.

* Unpaid maternity leave policies: The data shows that some companies do not offer unpaid maternity leave, while others offer significantly more than paid leave. For example, Guild Education provides no unpaid maternity leave, while Randstad USA provides 7 weeks. On average, companies in the dataset provide 5.2 weeks of unpaid maternity leave.

* Paternity leave policies: The data shows that paternity leave policies tend to be less generous than maternity leave policies, with some companies not providing any paid paternity leave. Bain & Company provides the highest amount of paid paternity leave at 21 weeks, while Epsilon and Randstad USA provide none. On average, companies in the dataset provide 5.9 weeks of paid paternity leave.

* Industry differences: The data shows that there are differences in maternity and paternity leave policies across industries. For example, companies in the "Business Services: Other" industry tend to provide more generous maternity leave policies than companies in the "Advertising" or "Consulting Services" industries. The "Consulting Services" industry tends to provide more generous paternity leave policies than other industries.

* Gender equality: While the dataset only includes information on maternity and paternity leave policies, it can be argued that companies with more generous policies are more likely to promote gender equality and support working parents. This may help companies attract and retain talent, especially women who may be more likely to consider leave policies when choosing a job or deciding to have children.
